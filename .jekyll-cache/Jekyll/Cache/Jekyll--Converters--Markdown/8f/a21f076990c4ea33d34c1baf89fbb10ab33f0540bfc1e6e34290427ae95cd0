I"u<p>Coffee is one of <a href="/things.html">my favorite things</a> and an important source of daily energy, which help me keep focus on work and be productive. I usually drink two cups of coffee provided by the company I serve every work day. And at the weekends, we need awesome coffee shops in Beijing city.</p>

<p>The data is powered by a open source project that I have contribute to all the time. It is called <a href="https://github.com/ElaWorkshop/awesome-cn-cafe">awesome-cn-cafe</a>, which is a curated list of awesome caf√© places in China. Currently, Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, Hangzhou, Guangzhou and Shenzhen are included.</p>
